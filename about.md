This aims to be a portfolio page, but will likely grow to a personal index.

Professional:
* Software Engineering
    * [Upstream](/upstream) is a list of my contributions to open-source projects.

Personal:
* [Book Reviews](/reviews).
* The site description sometime uses a [Boldomatic](http://boldomatic.com/) quote that speaks to me.
<!----
TODO:
* there should be a "Listening to" lastfm JS powered subtitle.
* need to create JS to download goodreads / imdb reviews.
