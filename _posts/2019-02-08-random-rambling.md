I don't even care that hidden posts appear in the page, at this point. Probably something else that needs to be configured and I haven't. But that's not the main point.

For instance, here's the thing. You've got something to say, or to find out, and you start searching. And then you question fucking everything. And while searching, you're doubting everything. Until you get it and, look, you're complete now. Because you've been moving towards yourself instead of away from yourself.

So what happens when looking back? Can you remember who you were when starting this? Will that person ever take credit? Does that person still exist? What trace is there to remind you of your younger self, the one that was by himself? That he would have to let go of who he was, to become something else, only to be forgotten. Why shouldn't the kid rebel, when he knows his days are limited? How can the rebel kid not be a rebel kid anymore?

Who documents this, all the people we were before becoming us? And not in a nostalgic, coloured way, when in old age. When everything is safe, and you can only look back in kindness.

Who was there, when ashamed? When angry? When desperate? On the first week at work, knowing you're gonna be doing that for the rest of your life. The one in which you're relevant to society, at least. When asking her hand, knowing that you're gonna spend the rest of your life with her. When hearing you're gonna be a father. One person that could make other persons, and did so. When you were alone. When you were scared. When you were hurting. Knowing for sure you can't do it.

This is what this is about. This is what it all is about. All the people you were. Screaming, calling for those you haven't been yet.
